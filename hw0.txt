# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I did not feel difficult, though this assignment required me to think a lot. I could just write instruction as “open up your eyes and count the words while keeping how many words you read in your head” but I felt inhumane to have people do that. What if someone must count whole words in a pdf that contains thousands of pages? Thus, I used 3rd party software to make the job easier. The way this makes the job easier satisfied me. However, at the end I felt unsatisfied because the users must have the software to follow my instruction.

I hope to gain good knowledge of programing in general, Python, and APIs. Also, I hope to develop good relationships with classmates and instructors.
